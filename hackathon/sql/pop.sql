 'Chalk Mountain Ranch 3,268 acres protected in 2010, 4,012 additional acres protected in 2012; a Six Rivers to the Sea property. The Barnwell Family has lived on Chalk Mountain Ranch, near the town of Bridgeville, CA for more than 125 years. ''Our primary goal is to keep the land that has been in our family for six generations. Keeping one''s land intact is becoming increasingly difficult these days,'' says Les Barnwell. ''We want to keep Chalk Mountain a working ranch and timberland, as well as continue to offer recreational activities,'' The Barnwells worked with the Land Trust to place a conservation easement on 7,280-acres of the ranch, located in the Larabee Creek watershed. Chalk Mountain Ranch is naturally scenic: conifer forests line its slopes and canyons and open oak woodlands and grasslands cover a good portion of the property. Its perennial streams and creeks provide good spawning and rearing habitat for native salmon and steelhead trout, and on iconic Chalk Rock, a pair of peregrine falcons has fledged every year since 1979. In addition, the Barnwells have diary records of the falcons from the 1920s. The first phase of the easement was completed at the beginning of 2010. This, and the subsequent 2012 easement on the Barnwell''s property, eliminated the potential for negative impacts caused by development, such as road sediment, water diversions and diesel pollution. The conservation easements also helped to protect clean drinking water for people living in the downstream communities of Fortuna and Ferndale.',

In 2005, the Land Trust purchased 54 acres of bottomland pasture from neighboring Freshwater Farms Nursery to facilitate a wetland restoration and enhancement project and to maintain agricultural uses. In 2012, NRLT acquired the 20-acre Freshwater Farms Nursery property reuniting it with the Freshwater Farms Reserve for a total of 74 acres. Located in an area historically dominated by tidal wetlands, the property was converted to pasture in the early 1900''s to support the growing agrarian culture in Humboldt County. Wood Creek, which runs through the property, meets with Freshwater Slough and is part of the larger Humboldt Bay tributary complex. The Land Trust, recognizing the need to reclaim wetland habitat that is vital to the successful rearing of salmon and steelhead, as well as other wetland-dependent species, worked with numerous public and private groups to design and implement the restoration. For details on the Freshwater Farms Reserve project click here. Elements of the restoration included: removal of a wooden-flap tide gate; construction of 3,200 feet of slough channels; removal of a 300-foot berm on the north bank of Wood Creek; construction of three habitat ponds; replacement of an old, crushed culvert with a modified flatbed trailer bridge; construction of tidal hummocks (shallow hills subject to tidal inundation); and revegetation of the entire project area with over 46,000 native wetland plants. All but the last activity were completed in late 2009. The planting phase began in late March and was completed by mid-April, 2010. The Land Trust has also continued to work with a local rancher to improve and maintain 20 acres outside of the project area for agriculture. In addition, the Land Trust hosts regular school and public field trips to the property to educate our community on wetland ecology, restoration, and productive, multiple-use land management. In 2015, NRLT completed a 0.75 mile nature trail, allowing daily access for community members. The Freshwater Nature Trail offers ample opportunities to identify native plants and trees, view birds of prey and other wildlife, learn about the local history and ecology, go boating from the non-motorized boat launch, view the restored area from a raised boardwalk, and take in the impressive views of the Kneeland Mountains and adjacent pastures. NRLT plans to do additional capital improvements on the property including: rehabilitating the historic Graham-Long Dairy Barn and rejuvenating the native plant nursery and garden. NRLT is also in the process of planning a second phase restoration project on Wood Creek, which will create additional habitat for salmonids upstream of the Phase 1 restoration.',

The Land Trust came on board with this project to purchase a 43-acre agricultural property at the mouth of Martin Slough in order to facilitate the first phase of the restoration, which included replacement of the defunct tide gate at the mouth with a more fish-friendly and functional tide gate. The phase one project also involved widening of the lower Martin Slough channel to increase flow capacity, construction of four acres of tidal wetland, establishment of riparian habitat along the slough, and enhancement of 28 acres of productive coastal pasture for grazing. Martin Slough hosts salmon and other aquatic species that use the Eureka Municipal Golf Course''s irrigation ponds for rearing habitat. In the second phase of the enhancement project, a number of the irrigation ponds on the Golf Course will be expanded to improve the available salmon habitat and the ability to contain flood waters, thereby increasing the number of days on which the Golf Course is playable and agricultural fields are available for grazing.

The younger Miller wished to preserve a contiguous single parcel and commence sustainable, selective timber harvest (Douglas fir and hardwoods) on certain areas of the property, while establishing timber reserve areas and riparian protection zones. The goal of these protection zones is to preserve the existing healthy stands of POC on the property, which fall in the southern extent of their range. These protection zones were created adjacent to and buffering USFS-owned POC reserves and old growth mixed conifer stands currently managed by the Six Rivers National Forest as ecological reserves. In addition, stands of Oregon white oak and canyon live oak will be preserved in these areas. Watercourse protections have been established along Three Creeks, Summit Creek, Panther Creek, and Willow Creek, to protect water quality and instream habitat for salmonid use and overall watershed health.
